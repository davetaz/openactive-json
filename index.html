<h1><a href='demo1/'>Demo 1</a></h1>
<p>A simple HTML demo of the JSONSchema input for open active.</p>
<p>This version is a non-scalable prototype to show the concept only!</p>
<h1><a href='demo2/'>Demo 2</a></h1>
<p>Starting to integrate the JSONSchema tool into our Adapt eLearning framework for easier creation and tracking of learning journeys</p>
<p>This version shows this principal working but the interface is not the best</p>
<h1><a href='demo3/'>Demo 3</a></h1>
<p>Stepping up to make the Adapt eLearning version look and feel more like a code academy course, complete with theming.</p>
<p>There is still much work to do to make the mobile responsive version look sensible and fix a load of the code before this can be used to create learning resources.</p>
<h1><a href='demo4/'>Demo 4</a></h1>
<p>Responsive version however the code editor still doesn't work on iPad or IOS even though the plugin is now included properly</p>
<p>Fixed: It now validates as you type and shows warnings</p>
<p>Fixed: Renamed components and tidied up themes. There are now three things required to build this:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/theodi/adapt-contrib-jsonSchema" target="_blank">adapt-contrib-jsonSchema</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/davetaz/adapt-theme-fullscreen-horizontal" target="_blank">adapt-theme-fullscreen-horizontal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/davetaz/adapt-articleBlockSlider" target="_blank">adapt-articleBlockSlider</a></li>
</ul>
<h1><a href='demo5/'>Demo 5</a></h1>
<p>Adding a new menu page for this theme.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/theodi/adapt-menu-compressed-menu" target="_blank">adapt-menu-compressed-menu</a></li>
</ul>
<h1><a href='demo6/'>Demo 6</a></h1>
<p>Added lesson structured and home button, started on pre-filled code, but this is not looking great yet.</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Add home button to top right of lessons and remove arrow</li>
</ul>
<h1><a href='demo7/'>Demo 7</a></h1>
<p>Fixed basically all the bits that needed fixing for Beta testing and completed a basic lesson 1 for comment! Hell yes!</p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Get the default starting point and pre-filled answers to work better</li>
    <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Record user answer so it refills it and remarks it properly when you revisit the module</li>
    <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Recording the answer from the previous exercise ready to use in the next one.</li>  
</ul>
<h1><a href='demo8/'>Demo 8</a></h1>
<p>Updated the style and added a width limiter on the screen (1280px) and on components (37em) so that text is confined. This generates white space.</p>
<h1><a href='demo9/'>Demo 9</a></h1>
<p>Started to add tracking and remixed lessons to end with a quiz.</p>
  <h2>To fix for beta testing</h2>
  <p>None currently!</p>
  <h2>Longer term fixes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix the weird shifting up of the code box when you get the answer right</li>
    <li>Make it work on iPad...somehow?!?!</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Required before launch</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Add licensing extension</li>
    <li>Add about page and attribution extension</li>
    <li>Update new theme for graphic attribution</li>
    <li>Create and test patch for graphic attribution in new framework</li>
    <li>Add all the code to the new theme for tracking progress in LRS using tracking hub</li>
  </ul>
</p>
