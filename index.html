<h1><a href='demo1/'>Demo 1</a></h1>
<p>A simple HTML demo of the JSONSchema input for open active.</p>
<p>This version is a non-scalable prototype to show the concept only!</p>
<h1><a href='demo2/'>Demo 2</a></h1>
<p>Starting to integrate the JSONSchema tool into our Adapt eLearning framework for easier creation and tracking of learning journeys</p>
<p>This version shows this principal working but the interface is not the best</p>
<h1><a href='demo3/'>Demo 3</a></h1>
<p>Stepping up to make the Adapt eLearning version look and feel more like a code academy course, complete with theming.</p>
<p>There is still much work to do to make the mobile responsive version look sensible and fix a load of the code before this can be used to create learning resources.</p>
<h1><a href='demo4/'>Demo 4</a></h1>
<p>Responsive version however the code editor still doesn't work on iPad or IOS even though the plugin is now included properly</p>
<p>Fixed: It now validates as you type and shows warnings</p>
<p>Fixed: Renamed components and tidied up themes. There are now three things required to build this:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/theodi/adapt-contrib-jsonSchema" target="_blank">adapt-contrib-jsonSchema</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/davetaz/adapt-theme-fullscreen-horizontal" target="_blank">adapt-theme-fullscreen-horizontal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/davetaz/adapt-articleBlockSlider" target="_blank">adapt-articleBlockSlider</a></li>
</ul>
<h1><a href='demo5/'>Demo 5</a></h1>
<p>Adding a new menu page for this theme.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/theodi/adapt-menu-compressed-menu" target="_blank">adapt-menu-compressed-menu</a></li>
  <h2>To Fix Still</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The weird shifting up of the code box when you get the answer right</li>
    <li>Record user answer so it refills it and remarks it properly when you revisit the module</li>
    <li>Recording the answer from the previous exercise ready to use in the next one (possibly make this a user feature as well?)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
</p>
