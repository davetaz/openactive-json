<h1><a href='demo1/'>Demo 1</a></h1>
<p>A simple HTML demo of the JSONSchema input for open active.</p>
<p>This version is a non-scalable prototype to show the concept only!</p>
<h1><a href='demo2/'>Demo 2</a></h1>
<p>Starting to integrate the JSONSchema tool into our Adapt eLearning framework for easier creation and tracking of learning journeys</p>
<p>This version shows this principal working but the interface is not the best</p>
<h1><a href='demo3/'>Demo 3</a></h1>
<p>Stepping up to make the Adapt eLearning version look and feel more like a code academy course, complete with theming.</p>
<p>There is still much work to do to make the mobile responsive version look sensible and fix a load of the code before this can be used to create learning resources.</p>
